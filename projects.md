#### Chronicle Outlier Detection
#### <small>June 2021 - September 2021</small>

> Worked with Amazon Active Defence security telemetry data, collected through the internal service called Chronicle, to to detect when a host in a homogenous class of hosts is suddenly exhibiting anomolous behavior. <br>
> Used PySpark to parse though daily AWS Chronicle data with 12-14 billion events per day, and benchmarked unsupervised machine learning algorithms to discover which worked best with the dataset's string based, command line argument features. <br>
> Mapped out daily/weekly host execution behavior across AWS accounts. <br>
> Discovered significant seasonality within AWS execution events and mapped out host execution behavior drift, leading to the discovery of potential malicious actors. <br>

#### Robo-optico
#### <small>January 2021 - Present</small>

> Used OpenCv and deep learning to teach object recognition, primarily humans <br>
> Utilized a raspberry pi and common USB camera as a platform for the recognition program <br>
> Future works will include building a behavior tree, inspired by the AI from the video game Alien Isolation, to have a mobile robot seek and follow humans <br> 
> Currently in the process of building the robot and developing the AI <br>


#### East Coast Energy Consumption
#### <small>September 2019 - December 2019</small>

> Used Time series analysis and regression tactics to model east coast energy use over the last decade <br>
> Plotted seasonality of energy use to find biweekly regional consumption spikes <br>

#### Black Friday Spending Analysis
#### <small>March 2019 - June 2019</small>

> Trained models using black friday consumer purchase  data from a retail chain to predict future consumer purchasing based on consumer traits <br>
> Utilized Random Forest and the CART algorithm

#### Park Usage Predictions Using Twitter Data
#### <small>September 2018 - December 2018</small>

> Trained regression models to predict park usage using twitter and social media data from the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area in Minnesota. 
> Used ANOVA to select for important features among parks and local neighborhoods.
